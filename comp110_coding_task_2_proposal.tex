The component I intend to develop for this assignment is a character behaviour AI. 
This component will be for my COMP150 group game and it will control the characters in the game when the player is not. Currently in the game the player will click on a character and then click where they want the character to go. Beyond that they do not move or react to anything, so to make the game more interesting I intend to use a Finite-State machine so that the characters do something other than just standing there.


My current idea is that  the states the player will have are; controlled by player, idle, wandering around a room, running from fire, running from hull breach and oxygen deprived. These states all fit with the theme of the game and make the characters less static. 

This component will be integrated into the current player component.
