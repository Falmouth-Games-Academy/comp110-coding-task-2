## proposal for my coding task 2 work.

For my coding task two i will take a component from my comp 150 group project game. I will be looking at the component where the hunter tracks the fox and shots at it and maybe as a stretch goal have the hunter lay traps. What I intend to create is a hunter who will chase the player at points during the level and attempt to hunt the fox by shooting the fox and laying traps and the players goal is to avoide the hunter and his traps. This component falls under the AI aspect of our COMP150 game because I intend to make the hunter track the fix by himself and shoot at it, reload and if i reach my stretch goal lay traps. I will take charge of the the hunter component in the group project.

##key aspects to my choosen mechanic
- 
- Hunter tracking fox
- hunter shooting when fox is in sight
- Hunter reloading when low on ammo
- hunter laying traps to catch the player
