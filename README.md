# comp110-coding-task-2

##Commits
For this assignment, the commits for this project are under SoftFox as is a component from that game.

##Proposal
The game component that I want to implement for this task is the physics for the playable character. This includes jumping, falling, and collisions. I think it is achieveable in the time given for this project.

##Key User Stories Needed
* As the player I want the sprite to fall in air
* As the player I want the sprite to be stationary when colliding with platform
* As the player I want the sprite to briefly jump up when space pressed

##Game for game component
The game that I am going to implement this component is the Comp150 project: Return Home.
