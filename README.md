## proposal for my coding task 2 work.

For my coding task two i will take a component from my comp 150 group project game. I will be looking at the component where the hunter moves around the screen and throw a net at the fox when it sees it and have the hunter lay traps. What I intend to create is a hunter who will move around certain points during the level and attempt to throw a net at the fox by shooting the fox and laying traps to catch not harm the fox because of the age demographic of our game and the players goal is to avoide the hunter and his traps and nets. This component falls under the AI aspect of our COMP150 game because I intend to make the hunter throw a net at the fox when it sees him and lay traps. I will take charge of the the hunter component in the group project.

##key aspects to my choosen mechanic
- Hunter moves around screen
- hunter Throws a net at fox when in sight
- hunter laying traps to catch the player
