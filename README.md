This is the repository for COMP110 Coding Task 2.
Please fork it and check in your code and other material as detailed in the assignment brief.

##Proposal
The game component that I want to implement for this task is the physics for the playable character. This includes jumping, falling, and collisions. I think it is achieveable in the time given for this project.

The game that I am going to implement this component is the Comp150 project: Return Home.
