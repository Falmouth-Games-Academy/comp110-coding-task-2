# COMP110 Coding Task 2 - Game Component

## Location
This project is being developed in the Group Desktop Game [Level Generation Branch](https://github.com/NecroReindeer/comp150-desktop-game/tree/level-generation). 
Classses and methods that are a part of this assignment will be indicated in the readme.md of that branch (after the final merge).

##Proposal
I intend to create a procedural level generator for our COMP150 game.
It will include:
* Generating the level layout so that it is appropriate for the game, that is, a maze of rooms that isn't overly complicated
* Placing Doctors and Guards in appropriate positions
* Placing the exit in an appropriate position
* Placing collectable items in appropriate positions
* Placing doors and locked doors in appropriate positions
* Ensuring that keycards are placed on the correct side of locked doors

###Proposal Trello Board
Note that the user stories will be made more specific as we develop and playtest the game
