## proposal for my coding task 2 work.

For my coding task two i will take a component from my comp 150 group project game. I will be looking at the component where the hunter moves around the screen and throw a net at the fox when it sees it and have the hunter lay traps which resets the player. What I intend to create is a hunter who will move around certain points during the level and attempt to throw a net at the fox and laying traps to catch the fox. I will take charge of the the hunter component in the group project.
